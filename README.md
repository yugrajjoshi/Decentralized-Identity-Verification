# Decentralized Identity Verification

## Project Title
**Decentralized Identity Verification**

## Project Description
A decentralized application (dApp) that enables individuals to store, submit, and verify identity documents on the blockchain in a secure and trustless manner. This solution uses smart contracts to handle the verification process without relying on centralized authorities.

## Project Vision
To build a transparent, censorship-resistant, and secure identity system that empowers users with full control over their personal information, making digital verification accessible and efficient for all.

## Key Features
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users submit identity proofs in hashed format.
- **Role-Based Verifiers**: Only approved verifiers can validate identity claims.
- **Decentralized Trust**: No central authority governs identity validation.
- **On-chain Verification**: All verifications are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
- **Permissioned Access**: Admin manages verifier roles.

## Future Scope
- Integration with zk-SNARKs or other zero-knowledge proof systems for privacy-preserving identity.
- Interoperability with DID standards like uPort or Ceramic.
- UI portal for easier identity submission and status checking.
- Verifier reputation and staking system to avoid malicious behavior.
